The Makefile for this document is not completely automated
because it needs graphics compiled and the Glossary generated.

Compiling graphics:
We archive the generated .pdf images, so they do not need to be generated.
They may be generated via "make graphics", but inkscape must be installed to do so.
Note that inkscape asks to embed or link each image to be prepared.
For each image: select "embed", which is the default, to continue.

Compiling with a correct Glossary:
1) Run make, which generates the document but does not build Glossary links.
2) Run "make glossary" to build the requisite glossary files.
3) touch the timestamp of beviewer-um.pdf so that it can be remade.
4) Run make to generate the document with the correctly generated glossary information.
