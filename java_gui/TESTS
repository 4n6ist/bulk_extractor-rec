* Automated tests:
Run regression tests under menu Help | Test.
This tests:
  runtime-persistent state.
  Ability to read a queue of features.

The mechanism for reading features is simply an automation of opening and automating a Case.
Create a case file manually by opening several Reports, bookmarking several Features
from several Feature Files from several Reports, selecting relative and embedded paths,
and saving the Case.

* Manual tests:
In addition to automated tests, currently, manuall testing is required for GUI systems.
Specifically, GUI actions start processes, most notably these two:
  1) Selecting a Feature file.
  2) Selecting a Feature.
Because these files can take a long time to read, These actions start readers on a non-Swing Thread.
When errors occur, they are reported using report requests that schedule on the Swing Thread.

This mechanism is loosely tested by selecting very large Feature files in the Reports pane
and verifying that the busy indicator engages during the read and that the Swing thread is free
(by typing text into a field, resizing the window, selecting another feature file, etc.)
If possible, we may want to read >7G Feature files.

Also, load-test the readers by selcting large feature files and feature entries
rapidly in succession.  This validates the ability to preempt selections that are loading, 
which is different from the automated tests, which load feature entries in succession.

* Features and Histograms:
Also note that there are two types of Feature files: regular Feature files and Histogram files.
They are treated differently: For Feature files, entries in Feature files are displayed in
the Features listing.  For Histogram files, Histogram entries are displayed in the Features
listing and Features from the Histogram file's associated Feature file is displayed in the
Referenced Feature listing.

This is loosely tested by selecting both feature file types in the Reports tree
and inspecting that the Feature listings are rendered.

* UI Capabilities:  Test the following:
- test highlighting by validating that feature text and user text are highlighted.
There are two formats for feature text: formatted feature text and image highlighting bytes.
These formats are generic for some feature files and specific to feature type for other feature files.
- test filtering by typing in a Feature Filter value and validating that only matching values
are highlighted.
Note that feature filters do not match the way highlighting does.
This will be confusing and needs to be changed.
The concern is that the change will run too slowly for large files.
- test buttons, text areas, and menu commands.  Verify that disablable controls are disabled
at the right times.
